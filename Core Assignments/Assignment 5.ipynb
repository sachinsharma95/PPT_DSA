The training data for the fraud detection system may include data about transactions that have already been flagged as fraudulent. If this data is not properly removed from the training set, then the model may learn to identify fraudulent transactions based on the features that are correlated with the target variable. This can lead to the model overfitting the training data and performing poorly on the test set.\n"

        "\n",
        "Cross-validation is a technique for evaluating the performance of a machine learning model. It involves splitting the data into a number of folds, and then training the model on a subset of the folds and evaluating it on the remaining folds. This process is repeated for each fold, and the results are averaged to get an estimate of the model's performance.\n",

        "**58. Why is cross-validation important?**\n",
        "\n",
        "Cross-validation is important because it provides a more accurate estimate of the model's performance than simply training the model on the entire dataset and evaluating it on a holdout set. This is because cross-validation helps to reduce the variance of the model's performance estimate.\n",

        "\n",
        "Stratified k-fold cross-validation is a variation of k-fold cross-validation where the folds are created such that the distribution of the target variable is the same in each fold. This is important for classification problems where the target variable is imbalanced.\n",

        "\n",
        "It is also important to consider the variance of the cross-validation scores. A high variance indicates that the model's performance is not stable. This can be caused by a number of factors, such as the choice of hyperparameters or the imbalance of the target variable.\n",
